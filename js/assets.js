      The main thought was to lodge two kids in quite a small room, and at the same time to save their personal space.<br />
      The room’s split into two separated zones for each child, with their bed and wardrobe. There is plenty of space for games and sports in the center of the room. The balcony was remodeled and became a study area.<br />
      The blue color for wallcovering was picked not by chance. The whole area is filled with sunlight all year round, so it makes the room pretty warm throughout the day and the blue color will cool it down a little bit.<br />
      Chalkboard board wallcovering opens new horizons for the creative thinking of the kids.

      <h1>New York, Broadway and West 69<sup>th</sup> Street</h1>
      This apartment is located in New York City, upper west side Manhattan, on the intersection of 69th and Broadway, and occupies an upper story apt of 448 sqft where the significant part of this area is the terrace (160sqft). The living space is only 288 sqft. The entrance, kitchen, and living areas all flow from one area to another. This is a kind of tiny apartment so popular these days in the crowded megapolis.<br/>
      Walls are painted with Sherwin-Williams interior paint where a deep blue one is “Naval” SW 6244 color, from Pottery Barn’s seasonal palette collection. It creates notable contrast with the floor-to-ceiling white cabinets of the kitchen, and warm-wood countertop and shelves as well as vermeil elements inherent to the space.<br/>
      Walnut hardwood floors can be found all over the place. The Bathroom has a very modest size, but still has everything you need.<br/>
      The terrace provides stunning views of the city skyline, perfectly suited for evening parties and even business meetings.

      The primary objective was to reconstruct the room, originally decorated in traditional style, and at the same time to add some notes of modernity.<br />
      The client’s principal request was to preserve heirloom elements like bookshelves and plaster moldings. They were also asked to leave the original hardwood floor and wallpaper during the renovation process. This was the starting point at the beginning of the project.
